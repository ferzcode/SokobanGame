# Sokoban Game

Welcome to Sokoban, a classic puzzle game where you push boxes to their designated locations!

## Overview

Sokoban is a single-player puzzle game originally created in the early 1980s. The objective is simple: move the player character to push all boxes onto their designated spots within the level. Once all boxes are correctly placed, the level is complete, and you can proceed to the next challenge.

## Rules

1. **Objective**: The goal of Sokoban is to push all boxes onto the designated target squares.
2. **Movement**: You control the player character using the WASD keys or arrow keys.
    - W (or Up Arrow): Move Up
    - A (or Left Arrow): Move Left
    - S (or Down Arrow): Move Down
    - D (or Right Arrow): Move Right
3. **Box Movement**: You can only push one box at a time.
4. **Obstacles**: Be careful not to push boxes into corners or against walls, as you may get stuck and unable to complete the level.
5. **Undo Move**: Some implementations allow you to undo your last move if you make a mistake.
6. **Restart**: If you find yourself stuck or unable to complete the level, you can usually restart the level to try again.
